# CPTR245: Lab 3 - Legacy Code

The lab this week focuses on improving an open source code base.
You will use the tools from the last lab: Continuous Integration, Code Quality, and Code Review.
The open source project is in the process of enabling these tools.
The course will involve several types of code improvement: improving code quality and system test coverage.
The course will also introduce peer code review and open source submission process.

## Project - ASWWU Backend Server
The ASWWU backend server is written in python and does not have any tests configured.
The project has started to get pytest up and running using Travis CI.
A simple API test has been created as an example REST API system test.
